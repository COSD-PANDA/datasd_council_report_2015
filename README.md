# Executive Summary

"Getting the right people, with the right skills, involved at the right time, in the right way, using the right data, to help make the right decision and create the right solution."

## Background
The City of San Diego collects, produces, and stores an enormous amount of data. Some examples include:

* Crime data
* Parking meter data
* Traffic counts
* Street paving
* Mapping data
* Many more

This data currently resides in a range of isolated and poorly integrated data stores, in multiple incompatible formats, and managed by non-interoperable platforms. This is data that has the potential to drive deeper understanding of civic activity and policy, drive transparency and accountability, and make the City a more efficient and information-driven leader on the broader civic landscape.

Properly enhanced and managed, this information has the potential to be used to:

* Facilitate decision-making by Mayor Faulconer and the City Council
* Increase transparency, efficiency, and accountability
* Allow better information sharing and usage by City employees
* Allow the community to build applications on top of the City’s data

It is the mission and commitment of the Performance & Analytics Department to shepherd this potential towards reality. 


## Benefits
1. **Empower** people to build applications that help residents, start businesses around those applications, and contribute to the overall **economic development** of the city.
2. **Empower** consumers of those applications to have the most up-to-date, relevant information at their fingertips.
3. Allow City employees to be more **efficient** and innovative by allowing them to get data from other departments faster and in an easily consumable format.
4. Allow taxpayers to benefit from a more **efficient**, nimble government that is capable of being responsive to them and delivering more under the same budget.
5. Be recognized as a leader in the space.


## Challenges
1. There are varying levels of understanding on what is considered to be data and open data.
2. We don’t know what data we have, how they’re stored and used.
3. There is no formal governance structure, and no defined responsibilities for the data we have, but we do have processes in place that can be formalized.
4. The data are closed. They are trapped in proprietary formats and databases that can only be read by expensive proprietary software.
5. The data sets are not described well and are subject to misinterpretation. 
6. Data creation, management and analysis efforts are often duplicated by multiple departments, oftentimes creating segmented data stores and unreliable data.
7. The right people, with the right skills often don’t have access to the right data at the right time to inform the right data-driven decisions and solve the right problems.

## Goals
1. Create a shared understanding within the city of what “data” and “open data” means.
2. Collaborate with all City departments to create an initial inventory.
3. Work with departments to create a structure by which there are responsibilities assigned for data oversight, and data is owned and updated.
4. Provide a process to release data in widely accessible, open formats which can be interpreted by a multitude of applications.
5. Collect, update, and provide metadata in a standardized format, and work to attribute meaning to the data.
6. Foster and expand interest in government data by various citizen groups including, but not limited to software developers, nonprofits, activist groups, elected officials, etc.
7. Empower the right people, with the right skills to have access to the right data at the right time, in the right way, to make the right decisions and to create the right solutions.

## Where we are today.
In the last 6 months, we have been able to begin addressing some of the core challenges we have identified and having progress on our goals.  

* As per the policy timelines, we have issued the inventory guidelines before March 31, 2015.
* By executing the inventory process, we were able to:
    * Begin collection of base level metadata.
    * Create a base knowledge of what information we have.
    * Begin to identify individuals currently working with specific sets of data. 
    * Begin to establish a common body of knowledge in the city about what data is.
    * Uncover some of the challenges mentioned above.
+ The Technical Guidelines are complete, but are always expected to change as they are meant to be a living document.
+ We are beginning to engage much more with the community of civic hackers and other people interested in the space.  In addition, the City of San Diego participated in the National Day of Civic Hacking by hosting three events over the weekend.  


## Where we are going.
* Perform a thorough analysis of the inventory.
* Based on the prioritization criteria, get data ready for release.
* Design a well-documented release and maintenance process that provides a release plan and accountability structure for every dataset that goes out.
* Procure an Open Data portal for being able to automatically publish datasets. 
* Exploring tools for automatically maintaining the inventory and doing additional data discovery.
* Increase internal capacity for using data to make decisions.
