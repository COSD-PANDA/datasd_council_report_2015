## Introduction
The City of San Diego collects, produces, and stores an enormous amount of data. Some examples include:

* Crime data
* Parking meter data
* Traffic counts
* Street paving
* Mapping data
* Many more

This data currently resides in a range of isolated and poorly integrated data stores, in multiple incompatible formats, and managed by non-interoperable platforms. This is data that has the potential to drive deeper understanding of civic activity and policy, drive transparency and accountability, and make the City a more efficient and information-driven leader on the broader civic landscape.

Properly enhanced and managed, this information has the potential to be used to do the following:

* Facilitate decision-making by Mayor Faulconer and the City Council
* Increase transparency, efficiency, and accountability
* Allow better information sharing by City employees
* Allow the community to build applications on top of the Cityâ€™s data

This information belongs to the taxpayer and should be provided to them in an open format. Data in an open format is in a convenient and modifiable form such that there are no unnecessary technological obstacles to its use. Specifically, data should be machine-readable, available in bulk, and provided in a format with a freely available published specification which places no restrictions, monetary or otherwise, upon its use (([http://opendefinition.org/ofd/](http://opendefinition.org/ofd/)). 

It is the mission and commitment of the Performance & Analytics Department to shepherd this potential towards reality.
