## Open Data Implementation Update
### July 1, 2015

Sections 2.4 and 2.5 of the City of San Diego (City) Open Data Policy require the Chief Data Officer to provide an annual written report to the Mayor and Council regarding the implementation of the Open Data Program. 

This inaugural 2015 report contains the findings from the City's first Open Data Inventory including an overview of the process, the results, and next steps.

The inventory process was well received, with 100% of invited departments participating.  In our initial run, we have identified over 1,200 datasets, yet more work remains to process and prioritize them for public release.  

The City is well on its way towards achieving the goals of the Open Data Policy.  In addition, we are on track to build a robust data management program that ensures the data we publish and maintain is  of high quality and up-to-date.  

This is not an easy effort and it would not have been possible without the support of Mayor Faulconer, the City's management team, yourself, or the City Council.  It has taken a team effort to put together what may be the largest and most comprehensive, not to mention first, data inventory effort of any government in this region.  I look forward to continuing to work together on implementing the Open Data program and making San Diego a leader in this space.
