## Council Report
### Open Data, July 1, 2015

This report is in response to the requirement in Section 2.4 of the City of San Diego Open Data Policy, that I, the Chief Data Officer - Maksim Pecherskiy provide a written status report to the Mayor and Council regarding the status of the implementation of the Open Data Policy.

Included in the report are the findings from the very first run of the City of San Diego Open Data Inventory.  Included is an overview of the results, as well as some retrospective content on the process and how we were able to accomplish the task.

In addition, I am outlining the goals and next steps for implementing the Open Data Policy.

Overall, I believe that the inventory process went well, with 100% of the targeted departments participating.  We have a large number of datasets collected, and still have lots of work to do in processing them and prioritizing all of them.  

Having completed this step, I feel extremely confident that San Diego is well on the way of achieving the goals of the Open Data Policy.  In addition, I believe we are well on our way to building a robust data management program that makes sure that the data we publish and maintain is timely and is of high quality.  

I truly appreciate your support in this effort as well as that of all the department directors, Mayor Faulconer and the Council.
