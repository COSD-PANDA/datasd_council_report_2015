# Open Format
Data in an open format is in a convenient and modifiable form such that there are no unnecessary technological obstacles to its use. Specifically, data should be machine-readable, available in bulk, and provided in a format with a freely available published specification which places no restrictions, monetary or otherwise, upon its use ([http://opendefinition.org/ofd/](http://opendefinition.org/ofd/)).
