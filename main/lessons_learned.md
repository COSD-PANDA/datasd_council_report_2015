# Lessons learned

* We have a ton of amazing talent in the city.  People that truly know the ins and outs of their jobs and are passionate about it.
* Communication is important.  We need to make sure that the way in which we communicate works for everyone, that everyone uses it, and understands it.  Analytics provides us a way of doing that.
* We have lots of good data.
* We have a lot of departments that have trouble receiving a continous flow of data from other departments.
* We have departments that do double the work to measure the same thing.

This is the information I learned from this exercise:

* We have not selected useful or relevant performance metrics.
* The data we have collected is largely unusable because it cannot be validated.
* In other words, we have been doing a lot of work/spending a lot of money for insignificant measurable effect or insignificant recognition of the effect - each option is bad.
* In other words, we have probably been focused on the wrong things and this inspires me to ask WHY? And that inquiry takes me down some very interesting roads to possible answers.
* This exercise leads me to believe that our department is unclear on its priorities or can't agree on its priorities or has not recently examined its priorities.
* This department is not adequately educated or skilled in managing and using data.
* If we use valid data as an end goal, we will be able to design our work smart from the start.

I had my suspicions about all of this already, but this exercise illuminated it in stark contrast.
