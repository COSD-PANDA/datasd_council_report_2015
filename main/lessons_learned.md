# Lessons Learned
* We have a plethora of amazing talent in the City.  City staff are passionate about their duties, committed to customer service, and knowledgeable about the ins and outs of their jobs.
* Communication is important.  We need to make sure that the way in which we communicate works for everyone, that everyone uses it and understands it.  Analytics provides us a tool to facilitate that.
* City departments could save time and avoid duplication of effort if we can set up a system with a continuous flow of data from other departments.
