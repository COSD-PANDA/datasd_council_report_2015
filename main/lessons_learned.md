# Lessons Learned
* We have a ton of amazing talent in the city.  People that truly know the ins and outs of their jobs and are passionate about it.
* Communication is important.  We need to make sure that the way in which we communicate works for everyone, that everyone uses it and understands it.  Analytics provides us a way of doing that.
* We have a large amount of good data.
* We have many departments that have trouble receiving a continous flow of data from other departments.
* We have departments that do double the work to measure the same thing.
