# Inventory 
## Purpose
The purpose of the Data Inventory is to get a bird's eye view of data we have in the city and to assist stakeholders like the Mayor, Council, the public to be able to identify data sets they consider high value for publication. 

It also has an added benefit of helping people find information much faster instead of relying on personal connections across departments. 

In addition, it provides for a logical beginning to cataloguing which data we have and the likelihood of its release on the open data portal, taking into account all reasons it may not be able to be released.

Lastly, by understanding who is responsible for working with which data sources around the city, we are able to begin to form a governance for data that is released as well as data that is used internally.

## Process Overview
The first part of the inventory was to assign information coordinators from each department to work with the Chief Data Officer.  Several larger departments chose to assign multiple coordinators since these people knew their divisions best.  However, most departments assigned a single point of contact to work with the CDO.  It was important for information coordinators to be knowledgeable in the business level of how the department operates, since they would oftentimes need to make decisions based on that knowledge.

The inventory process was designed with the following constraints in mind:

* The information coordinators' time must be used as efficiently as possible.
* Coordinators do not have a high level of technical knowledge.
* Time frame of only 3 months.
* Technology must not be a bottleneck.
* People forget things, so they need to work in short spurts.
* The CDO must not be a bottleneck.

From these constraints, we made sure to emphasize the following:

* Minimize large in-person meetings.
* Be available for small face-to-face meetings, but prefer online collaboration.
* Provide all information all the time.
* Continously collect feedback.
* Say no to perfection.
* Automate repeatable tasks.
* Allow to technology to increase execution velocity.
* Break down large chunks of work into smaller ones.
* Create infrastructure for future growth.

### Kickoff
Initially, it was necessary to have a kickoff to get as many questions answered as possible, to get as many coordinators engaged as possible, and to introduce the process.  There were two such meetings scheduled, in order to allow for variation in people's schedules.  Each of these meetings was two hours long, and it was the only large meeting we have had during the process.

### Process
The inventory is broken down into three steps, with coordinators given one month to complete each step.  

The overall structure for the process was very much inspired by that of San Francisco's inventory, and it's important to acknowledge the wonderful work Joy Bonaguro, the CDO of San Francisco did in creating this process.
