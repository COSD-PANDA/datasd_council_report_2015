# Next Steps

## Perform a thorough analysis of inventory data.
Since the inventory is human generated, we need considerable cleaning of the data in order to correct duplicative and inconsistent data entry.  In addition, we have yet to merge information from nonhuman sources to validate, and possibly supplement, today's inventory. Finally, there are risks that our current data may expose Personally Identifiable Information (PII), or cybersecurity vulnerabilities. After we have verified the inventory data and taken steps to mitigate these potential vulnerabilities, we will post it for public review and prioritization. By September 2015, we plan to post an index of public data sets for review and input towards high value data sets for release through the portal.

## Procure an Open Data Portal.
Since it is difficult for many people to understand data when it is provided in a purely machine readable format, we plan to procure a software solution for making user-friendly visualizations of such information.  In addition, this software will host our datasets.

## Make the inventory process routine and more efficient.
The initial inventory largely relied on human input, but as we continue along the path of treating our data as a valued asset, we will explore and implement options to automate inventory maintenance and contextualize as much as possible.

## Continue to provide context to city data and engage with the community.
We will continue our community outreach and engagement efforts with Open San Diego. We will explore new avenues for contextualizing city data, so that it can be consumed by all interested parties.   We will pursue partnerships with nonprofits or educational institutions to analyze data for the betterment of our communities and our City operations.

## Continue refinement and updates of technical guidelines.
We designed technical guidelines to operate as a living document, and we will continue to adjust as we move along the process of publishing data.  A well-designed release and management process--one that ensures any data released to the portal continues to be up-to-date--will be a key component of the technical guidelines.

## Identify high value data sets and prioritize data for release.
After the inventory data is cleaned and analyzed, we will prioritize data based on the plan outlined in the technical guidelines for release. While it may be subject to change, it is included in this report in the [Attachments](../attachments/prioritization.md) section.

## Review and potentially update Open Data Policy.
Since the Policy calls for a yearly review of itself, we will be reviewing the Open Data Policy before the end of the calendar year.

## Begin to release data by July 1, 2016
We are still on schedule to begin data releases by July 1, 2016.
