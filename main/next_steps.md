# Next Steps

#### Perform a thorough analysis of inventory data.
Since the inventory is human generated, we expect the need for considerable cleaning of the data to correct duplicative and inconsistent data entry intro the inventory.  In addition, we have yet to merge information from sources that are not human generated to validate, and possibly supplement, today's inventory. Finally, there are risks that our current data may expose Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or cybersecurity vulnerabilities. After we have verified the inventory data and taken steps to mitigate these potential vulnerabilities, we will be posting it for public review and prioritization. We anticipate beginning to post an index of public data sets by September 2015 for review and input towards high value data sets for release through the portal.

#### Data prioritization.
After the inventory data is cleaned and analyzed, we will prioritize data based on the plan outlined in the technical guidelines for release. 

#### Procure an Open Data Portal.
Since it is difficult for many people to understand data when it is provided in a purely machine readeable format, we plan to procure a software solution for making user-friendly visualizations of such information.  In addition this software will host our datasets.


#### Make the inventory process more efficient.
The initial inventory largely relied on human input, but as we continue along the path of treating our data as a valued asset, we will explore and implement options to automate inventory maintenance and contextualization as much as possible.

#### Continue to provide context to city data and engage with the community.
We will continue our community outreach and engagement efforts with Open San Diego. We will explore new avenues for contextualizing city data, so that it can be consumed by all interested parties.   We will pursue partnerships with nonprofits or educational institutions to analyze data for the betterment of our communities and our City operations.

#### Continue education initiatives.
We will continue making sure everyone in the City has a shared understanding of the meaning of data and its potential uses.  We will leverage our department's other initiatives, such as the Strategic Planning program, to use open data for a performance monitoring.  This will drive the City towards a more data-driven culture in its decision-making processes.

#### Continue refinement of technical guidelines.
Technical guidelines are designed to operate as a living document and will continue to be adjusted as we move along the process of publishing data.  A key component of the technical guidelines will be a well-designed release and management process that ensures any data released to the portal continues to stay up to date.
