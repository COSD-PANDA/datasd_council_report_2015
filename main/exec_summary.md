# Executive Summary

The City of San Diego is committed to the principles of open, accessible, efficient, and transparent government, as well the use of technology to help put those principles into practice.  Mayor Faulconer created the Performance & Analytics Department on July 1, 2014.  Its purpose is to focus on citywide efficiency, accountability, and transparency initiatives.  On December 16, 2014, the Council passed the City's Open Data Policy with his strong support.

Opening up the City's data ties in directly with each of our Strategic Goals and allows us to monitor our progress in achieving them:

* Provide High Quality Public Service
* Work in partnership with all our communities to achieve safe and livable neighborhoods.
* Create and sustain a resilient, economically prosperous city.

For additional background and history of the Open Data Program in the City, please refer to the following: [http://bit.ly/sdodpres](http://bit.ly/sdodpres).

The overarching vision for the program is to get the right people, with the right skills, involved at the right time, in the right way, using the right data, to help make the right decision and create the right solution.

## Background
The City collects, produces, and stores an enormous amount of data.  Some examples include:

* Crime data
* Parking meter data
* Traffic counts
* Street paving
* Mapping data

These data currently reside in a range of isolated and non-integrated data repositories, in multiple incompatible formats, and are managed by non-interoperable platforms.  These data have the potential to drive deeper understanding of civic activity and policy, drive transparency and accountability, and make the City a more efficient and data-driven leader on the global civic landscape.

Properly enhanced and managed, these data has the potential to:

* Facilitate decision-making by Mayor Faulconer and the City Council.
* Increase transparency, efficiency, and accountability.
* Improve information sharing and use by City employees.
* Allow the community to conduct analyses and build applications on top of the Cityâ€™s data.

The Performance & Analytics Department is committed to guiding this potential towards reality. 


## Benefits of Open Data
1. **Empower** people to build applications that assist residents, start businesses around those applications, and contribute to the overall **economic development** of the City.
2. **Empower** consumers of City data-based applications to have the most up-to-date, relevant information at their fingertips.
3. Allow City employees to be more **efficient** and innovative by allowing them to get data from other departments more quickly and in an easily consumable format.
4. Allow taxpayers to benefit from a more **efficient**, nimble government that is capable of being responsive to them and able to deliver more with the same level of resources.
5. Be recognized globally as a leader in the space.



## Open Data Program Goals
1. Increase data literacy within the City and with those who interact with the City.
    * There are various levels of understanding of what are data, metadata, Open Data, etc.
2. Manage data like an asset, formalizing existing oversight and ownership.
    * Take existing data management and responsibility structures, build on them and formalize them to create a robust data management program that would prevent data duplication and rework, as well as ensure sustainability of Open Data release.
3. Release data to the public via a strategic and predictable process.
    * Data releases must account for a multitude of factors, including but not limited to communications with stakeholders, data integrity, personally identifiable information (PII), and ensuring that we describe and release data in a way that meets Open Format specifications.
4. Ensure that data are well described and catalogued.
    * Understanding what data we have is crucial to both Open Data and data management.  We worked with departments to create an initial inventory, and now we need to provide processes for how it can stay current.  
5. Support increased use of data in decision making, as well as innovations in Open Data use.
    * We have a talented City workforce that makes data-driven decisions every day.  In addition, fostering and expanding interest in government data from residents and other users is crucial to delivering the benefits of an Open Data program.

## Where we are today.
In the last 6 months, we have made significant progress on all 5 of our goals:
* Consistent with the policy timeline, we issued the inventory guidelines on March 9, before the March 31, 2015 deadline.
* By creating the City's first ever Data Inventory, we were able to:
    * Collect base level attributes about the City's data. (Goal 4)
    * Create a base knowledge of information at the City's disposal. (Goals 2, 4, 5)
    * Identify individuals currently working with specific sets of data. (Goal 2) 
    * Begin to establish a common body of knowledge in the City about what data are. (Goal 1 and 5).
    * Understand which of the City's software systems are authoritative for various pieces of information. (Goal 2, 4, 5)
+ Consistent with the policy, a draft version of the Technical Guidelines is ready, but is currently going through internal review before formalization. (All Goals)
+ We are enhancing our engagement with the civic hacking community and other interested stakeholders. For example, the City participated in the National Day of Civic Hacking by co-hosting three events on June 5th and 6th.  (Goal 5)

## Next Steps.
* Perform a thorough analysis of inventory data.
* Procure an Open Data Portal.
* Make the inventory process routine and more efficient.
* Continue to provide context to City data and engage with the community.
* Continue refinement and updates of technical guidelines.
* Identify high value datasets and prioritize data for release.
* Review and potentially update Open Data Policy.
* Begin to release data by July 1, 2016.
