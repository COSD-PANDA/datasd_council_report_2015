# Executive Summary

Getting the right people, with the right skills, involved at the right time, in the right way, using the right data, to help make the right decision and create the right solution.

## Background
The City collects, produces, and stores an enormous amount of data. Some examples include:

* Crime data
* Parking meter data
* Traffic counts
* Street paving
* Mapping data
* Many more

This data currently resides in a range of isolated and poorly integrated data stores, in multiple incompatible formats, and managed by non-interoperable platforms. This is data that has the potential to drive deeper understanding of civic activity and policy, drive transparency and accountability, and make the City a more efficient and information-driven leader on the broader civic landscape.

Properly enhanced and managed, this information has the potential to be used to:

* Facilitate decision-making by Mayor Faulconer and the City Council
* Increase transparency, efficiency, and accountability
* Allow better information sharing and usage by City employees
* Allow the community to build applications on top of the City’s data

It is the mission and commitment of the Performance & Analytics Department to shepherd this potential towards reality.

## Benefits
1. **Empower** people to build applications that assist residents, start businesses around those applications, and contribute to the overall **economic development** of the city.
2. **Empower** consumers of those applications to have the most up-to-date, relevant information at their fingertips.
3. Allow City employees to be more **efficient** and innovative by allowing them to get data from other departments faster and in an easily consumable format.
4. Allow taxpayers to benefit from a more **efficient**, nimble government that is capable of being responsive to them and delivering more under the same budget.
5. Be recognized as a leader in the space.


## Challenges
1. There are varying levels of understanding on what is considered to be data and open data.  
2. There is no formal governance structure, and no defined responsibilities for the data we have, but we do have processes in place that can be formalized.
3. The data are closed. They are trapped in proprietary formats and databases that can only be read by expensive proprietary software.  They are not described well, creating space for misinterpretation.
4. We don’t know what data we have, how they’re stored and used.
5. Data creation, management and analysis efforts are often duplicated by multiple departments.


## Goals
1. Increase data literacy within the city and outside of it.
    * There are various levels of understanding of what is data, metadata, open data, etc.
2. Manage data like an asset, formalizing existing oversight and ownership.
    * Take existing data management and responsibility structures, build on them and formalize them to create a robust data management program.
3. Release data to the public via a strategic and predictable process.
    * The process of data release should be predictable and strategically thought out from multiple perspectives, including communications and sustainability.  In addition, data released should be described and formatted in a specific way that meets the open standard specifications.
4. Make sure that data is well described and catalogued.
    * Understanding what data we have is crucial to both open data and data management.  Work with departments to create an initial inventory, and provide processes for how it can stay up to date.  In addition, provide robust metadata.
5. Support increased use of data in decision making as well as innovations in open data use.
    * We have a lot of talented people in the city who make data-driven decisions every day.  In addition, fostering and expanding interest in government data from citizens is crucial to a successful open data program.

## Where we are today.
In the last 6 months, we have been able to begin addressing some of the core challenges we have identified and having progress on our goals.  

* As per the policy timelines, we have issued the inventory guidelines before March 31, 2015.
* By executing the inventory process, we were able to:
    * Begin collection of base level metadata.
    * Create a base knowledge of what information we have.
    * Begin to identify individuals currently working with specific sets of data. 
    * Begin to establish a common body of knowledge in the city about what data is.
    * Uncover some of the challenges mentioned above.
+ The Technical Guidelines are ready, but we are awaiting feedback and changes.
+ We are beginning to engage much more with the community of civic hackers and other people interested in the space.  In addition, the City participated in the National Day of Civic Hacking by hosting three events over the weekend.  


## Next Steps.
* Perform a thorough analysis of inventory data.
* Procure an Open Data Portal.
* Make the inventory process more efficient.
* Continue to provide context to city data and engage with the community.
* Continue education initiatives.
* Continue refinement of technical guidelines.
* Data prioritization.
* We are still on track to release data by July 1, 2016.
