# Executive Summary

Getting the right people, with the right skills, involved at the right time, in the right way, using the right data, to help make the right decision and create the right solution. I THINK THE OPENER SHOULD SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE PROGRAM HISTORY LIKE COUNCIL APPROVED A POLICY ON ......AND THEN ADD THE HYPERLINK. PERHAPS YOU CAN CLOSE YOUR OPENING PARAGRAPH WITH THE SENTENCE ABOVE.

## Background
The City collects, produces, and stores an enormous amount of data.  Some examples include:

* Crime data
* Parking meter data
* Traffic counts
* Street paving
* Mapping data

These data currently reside in a range of isolated and non-integrated data stores [CAN WE SAY REPOSITORIES INSTEAD...OR SOME OTHER WORD, STORES IS A WEIRD WORD, THOUGH I KNOW IT'S TECHNICALLY CORRECT], in multiple incompatible formats, and IS managed by non-interoperable platforms.  These data has the potential to drive deeper understanding of civic activity and policy, drive transparency and accountability, and make the City a more efficient and information[WHY INFORMATION AND NOT DATA HERE?]-driven leader on the broader civic landscape.

Properly enhanced and managed, this information has the potential to be used to:

* Facilitate decision-making by Mayor Faulconer and the City Council
* Increase transparency, efficiency, and accountability
* Allow better information sharing and usage by City employees
* Allow the community to conduct analyses and build applications on top of the City’s data

It is the mission and commitment of the Performance & Analytics Department to shepherd this potential towards reality. 

For additional background and history of the Open Data Program in the City, please refer to the following: [http://bit.ly/sdodpres](http://bit.ly/sdodpres)


## Benefits of Open Data
1. **Empower** people to build applications that assist residents, start businesses around those applications, and contribute to the overall **economic development** of the city.
2. **Empower** consumers of those applications to have the most up-to-date, relevant information at their fingertips.
3. Allow City employees to be more **efficient** and innovative by allowing them to get data from other departments faster and in an easily consumable format.
4. Allow taxpayers to benefit from a more **efficient**, nimble government that is capable of being responsive to them and delivering more with the same level of resources.
5. Be recognized globally as a leader in the space.


## Challenges of Open Data [this subsection is starting to feel duplicative - we address some of this in the Goals section; perhaps just take this section and translate  the remaining elements under the Goals]
1. There are varying levels of understanding on what is considered to be data and Open Data.  
2. There is no formal governance structure, and no defined responsibilities for the data we have, but we do have processes in place that can be formalized.
3. The data are closed.  They are trapped in proprietary formats and databases that can only be read by expensive proprietary software.  They are not described well, creating space for misinterpretation.
4. Until now, we have not known what data we have or how they’re stored and used.
5. Data creation, management and analysis efforts may be duplicated by multiple departments.


## Open Data Program Goals
1. Increase data literacy within the city and outside of it.
    * There are various levels of understanding of what are data, metadata, Open Data, etc.
2. Manage data like an asset, formalizing existing oversight and ownership.
    * Take existing data management and responsibility structures, build on them and formalize them to create a robust data management program.
3. Release data to the public via a strategic and predictable process.
    * The process of data release should be predictable and strategically developed taking into account all information, including communications and sustainability. [THIS FIRST SENTENCE DOESN'T SAY MUCH - MAY BE WE SHOULD JUST SAY THAT THE PROCESS SHOULD BE PREDICTABLE AND STRATEGIC]  In addition, data released should be described and formatted in a way that meets the open standard specifications.
4. Make sure that data is well described and catalogued.
    * Understanding what data we have is crucial to both Open Data and data management.  Work with departments to create an initial inventory, and provide processes for how it can stay current.  In addition, provide robust metadata.
5. Support increased use of data in decision making as well as innovations in Open Data use.
    * We have a talented City workforce that makes data-driven decisions every day.  In addition, fostering and expanding interest in government data from residents and other users/consumers [PICK USERS OR CONSUMERS] is crucial to a successful Open Data program.

## Where we are today.
In the last 6 months, we have made significant progress on all 5 of our goals.  [SINCE WE ARE ALL ABOUT PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT, WE NEED TO STATE HOW MANY OF THE GOALS WE HAVE MADE PROGRESS ON; IF YOU LEAVE THE CHALLENGES SECTION, YOU'LL WANT TO SAY HOW MANY CHALLENGES WE HAVE MADE PROGRESS ON; I'M EVEN CONSIDERING WHETHER WE NEED A PERFORMANCE INDICATOR TABLE THAT SHOWS WHAT PERCENTAGE OF EACH GOAL WE FEEL WE HAVE ACHIEVED AT THIS STAGE, WHICH WE COULD THEN UPDATE ANNUALLY]

* Consistent with the policy timelines, we issued the inventory guidelines on [INSERT THE DATE WE ISSUED THEM], before the March 31, 2015 deadline.
* By executing the inventory process, we were able to:
    * Begin collection of base level metadata. [IS THIS IN YOUR GLOSSARY?]
    * Create a base knowledge of information at the City's disposal.
    * Identify individuals currently working with specific sets of data. 
    * Begin to establish a common body of knowledge in the City about what data are.
    * Identify new challenges. [NOT SURE IF WE KEEP THIS BULLET - I FEEL LIKE AT LEAST 3 OF THE 5 CHALLENGES WE ALREADY KNEW]
+ Consistent with the policy, a draft version of the Technical Guidelines is ready, but is currently going through internal review before formalization.
+ We are enhancing our engagement with the civic hacking community and other interested stakeholders. For example, the City participated in the National Day of Civic Hacking by co-hosting three events on June 6th [CORRECT?].  

## Next Steps.
* Perform a thorough analysis of inventory data.
* Procure an Open Data Portal.
* Make the inventory process routine and more efficient.
* Continue to provide context to City data and engage with the community.
* Continue education initiatives. [NOT SURE HOW THIS IS DIFFERENT FROM BULLET ABOVE AND WHAT YOU WOULD USE AS AN EXAMPLE - IMAGINE A COUNCILMEMBER ASKING FOR EXAMPLES ON ANY ONE OF THESE GENERALITIES AND HOW YOU WOULD ANSWER IT]
* Continue refinement and updating of technical guidelines.
* Identify high value data sets and prioritize data for release.
* [DO WE WANT TO ADD A BULLET:  "REVIEW AND POTENTIALLY UPDATE OPEN DATA POLICY? - AN ANNUAL REVIEW IS REQUIRED AND MAYBE THERE'S SOME TWEAKS YOU'D LIKE TO MAKE BY THE TIME DECEMBER ROLLS AROUND]
* Begin to release data by July 1, 2016.
