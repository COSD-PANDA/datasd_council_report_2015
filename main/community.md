# Community Involvement

## Purpose
From the very beginning, it was evident that in order for open data to be successful within the city, there had to be a community outreach component.  That component began with Open San Diego, working closely with Code for America. 

## Open San Diego
In the past six months, [Open San Diego](http://opensandiego.org/), led by Xavier Leonard, has accelerated their activities, and are now a regular meetup group that I work with on a regular basis.  They have several [ongoing projects](https://github.com/opensandiego) and are working with other communities to increase membership and civic engagement with data.

In order to build proper context between the community and city employees, I have been asking various city employees to come and present at Open San Diego.  This has truly flourished the relationship between the city and the civic hacking community and has so far proven to be a great endeavour.  The following people have spoken at Open San Diego:

* Jonathan Behnke (CIO)
* Scott Daeschner (GIS Manager)
* Maksim Pecherskiy (CDO)
* DeeDee Alari, Jonathan Carey, Mary Davis (City Treasurer)

In addition, many other city employees have become regular attendees of Open San Diego Meetings and are actively working on civic hacking projects.

They held 3 simultaneous events this year for the [National Day of Civic Hacking](http://hackforchange.org/events/code-for-san-diego-national-day-event/), in which many software developers and others from the community got involved.

There were 18F people that showed up [18f People Show Up](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/06/11/18f-at-national-civic-hacking-day/) and San Diego was recognized on a national stage.

## Cyberhive 
Cyberhive in partnership with AT&T as well as the City hosted a hackathon to built applications on top of the city's already open data.  Below are some tweets of the apps that were built:

The bulk of work for this project was done by Gary Hayslip (CISO), and Jim Meyers (DSD) and Jonathan Behnke (CIO) were in attendance.
