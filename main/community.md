# Community Involvement

## Purpose
Community outreach and engagement is critical for any Open Data effort to be successful.  Engagement is largely driven by with the local Code for America brigade - Open San Diego. 

## Open San Diego
Open San Diego was a staunch advocate for adopting the Open Data Policy and hiring a Chief Data Officer.  In the past six months, [Open San Diego](http://opensandiego.org/) under the leadership of Xavier Leonard, has accelerated its activities.  It is now a regular group that we partner with on a regular basis.  It has several [ongoing projects](https://github.com/opensandiego), such as [...insert a few examples or bullet point a list] and is working with other interested stakeholders to increase membership and civic engagement with data.

In order to build proper context between the community and the City, the following City employees have stepped up and presented at Open San Diego, upon our request:

* Jonathan Behnke (CIO)
    - Jonathan had a great presentation and discussion with the group about the City's IT infrastructure, forward plans and roadmap.
* Scott Daeschner (GIS Manager)
    - Scott did a great job describing the ecosystem of GIS (mapping) information within the City as well as the Region.
* Maksim Pecherskiy (CDO)
    - Maksim talked about how to use Git and Github, as well as about his experience working with the local brigade in Puerto Rico.
* DeeDee Alari, Jonathan Carey, Mary Davis (City Treasurer)
    - DeeDee, Jonathan and Mary talked to the group about the City's Smart Meter program, and the data that is collected and generated by those meters.  It was a lively discussion about parking, meters, their purpose and placement.

These appearances enhance the relationship between the City and the civic hacking community.  In addition, other City employees have become regular attendees of Open San Diego Meetings and are actively working on civic hacking projects.

Open San Diego coordinated 3 simultaneous events on June 5 and 6, 2015 for the [National Day of Civic Hacking](http://hackforchange.org/events/code-for-san-diego-national-day-event/), in which many software developers and others from the community got involved.

Team members from 18F, a top notch team of designers, developers and product specialists embedded in the GSA had representatives at the event.  The City was [recognized on a national stage](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/06/11/18f-at-national-civic-hacking-day/).

## CyberTech 
On May 30 and 31 CyberTech, a global cybersecurity and Internet of Things network ecosystem, in partnership with the City and AT&T hosted a hackathon to build applications on top of the City's already open data.  Below are some tweets referring to some of the apps that were under construction.
