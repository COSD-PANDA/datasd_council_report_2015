# Community Involvement

## Open San Diego
In the past six months, [Open San Diego](http://opensandiego.org/) has accelerated their activities, and are now a regular meetup group who I work with on a regular basis.  They have several [ongoing projects](https://github.com/opensandiego) and are working with other communities to increase membership and civic engagement with data.

They held 3 simultaneous events this year for the [National Day of Civic Hacking](http://hackforchange.org/events/code-for-san-diego-national-day-event/), in which many software developers and others from the community got involved.  

We even had some [18f People Show Up](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/06/11/18f-at-national-civic-hacking-day/)
