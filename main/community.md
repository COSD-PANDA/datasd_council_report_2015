# Community Involvement

## Purpose
Community outreach and engagement is critical for any Open Data effort to be successful. Engagement is largely driven by with the local Code for America brigade - Open San Diego. 

## Open San Diego
Open San Diego was a staunch advocate for adopting the Open Data Policy and hiring a Chief Data Officer. In the past six months, [Open San Diego](http://opensandiego.org/) under the leadership of Xavier Leonard, has accelerated its activities. It is now a regular meetup group that we partner with on a regular basis.  It has several [ongoing projects](https://github.com/opensandiego), such as [...insert a few examples or bullet point a list] and is working with other interested stakeholders to increase membership and civic engagement with data.

In order to build proper context between the community and the City, the following City employees have stepped up and presented at Open San Diego, upon our request:

* Jonathan Behnke (CIO) [INSERT BRIEF TOPIC DESCRIPTION OF WHAT EACH TALKED ABOUT AT THE EVENT, SO THAT THERE IS CONTEXT TO THE PHOTO UNDERNEATH]
* Scott Daeschner (GIS Manager)
* Maksim Pecherskiy (CDO)
* DeeDee Alari, Jonathan Carey, Mary Davis (City Treasurer)

These appearances enhance the relationship between the City and the civic hacking community. In addition, other City employees have become regular attendees of Open San Diego Meetings and are actively working on civic hacking projects.

Open San Diego coordinated 3 simultaneous events on June 6 [DATE CORRECT?] for the [National Day of Civic Hacking](http://hackforchange.org/events/code-for-san-diego-national-day-event/), in which many software developers and others from the community got involved.

We even had  participation from representatives of 18F, [DEFINE TERM: SOMETHING LIKE: a group of technologists embedded in federal agencies] [18f People Show Up](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/06/11/18f-at-national-civic-hacking-day/) and San Diego was recognized on a national stage. [SEEMS LIKE THE LINK TO THE STORY SHOULD BE ON THE "recognized on a national stage] [WOULD BE NICE IF WE COULD SHOW SOME EXAMPLES OF APPS BUILT AND ESPECIALLY ANY THAT HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED... BETWEEN THIS AND CYBERHIVE, IS THERE AN EXAMPLE OF AN APP THAT HAS BEEN BUILT ON OUR WATCH YET?]

## Cyberhive 
On [INSERT DATE] Cyberhive, [DEFINE BRIEFLY THE GROUP], in partnership with the City and AT&T hosted a hackathon [YOU MAY NEED TO ADD THE WORD hACKATHON TO YOUR GLOSSARY ;) NO JOKE] to build applications on top of the City's already open data.  Below are some tweets referring to some of the apps that were under construction [WE MAY WANT TO TAKE OUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE ONE AS AN EXAMPLE GIVEN THE RECENT 311 THING THAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW] [ALSO, ARE THESE APPS LIVE NOW?]:

The bulk of work for this project was done by Gary Hayslip (CISO), and Jim Meyers (DSD) and Jonathan Behnke (CIO) were in attendance. [CANT FIGURE OUT THE PURPOSE OF THIS SENTENCE - THE BULK OF THE WORK FOR THE CYBERHIVE OR FOR THAT ONE APP?  I'D BREAK THIS INTO TWO SENTENCES IF YOU WANT TO KEEP IT]
