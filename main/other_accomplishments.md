# Other Accomplishments
## OpenGov
In partnership with Financial Management and the CIO, we launched a public-facing budget tool, OpenGov, that to our knowledge is among the most transparent budget visualizations in the country.

Notably, our OpenGov launch took less than 4 weeks, making it the fastest large city deployment.  Additionally, we are one of only a few cities that house the tool under a subdomain of sandiego.gov. We plan to upload FY 16 adopted as well as historical budget data in the near future and continue to work with the vendor to develop new functionality. In June 2015, our Director presented San Diego's story on this visualization and our Open Data program during a financial transparency webinar.

The tool is accessible at [https://budget.sandiego.gov](https://budget.sandiego.gov).  

## City Clerk
Although not live yet, we repurposed the coordinator dashboard code for the City Clerk to help her office keep track of Records Disposition Schedules.

## Meetings with Foreign Delegations
As the City moves along its open data program, we are beginning to get globally recognized for our thoughtful and insightful approaches to how we are doing open data.

So far, we have met with delegations from Macedonia and the Phillipines to discuss our advances in Open Data and Open Government:
