# Other Accomplishments.
## OpenGov.
In April 2015, the City launched a public-facing budget tool, OpenGov, that to our knowledge is among the most transparent budget visualizations in the country.

Notably, our OpenGov launch took less than 4 weeks, making it the fastest large city deployment.  Additionally, we are one of only a few cities that house the tool under a [subdomain of sandiego.gov](https://budget.sandiego.gov). We plan to upload FY 16 adopted as well as historical budget data in the near future. We also continue to work with the vendor to develop new functionality. In June 2015, our Director presented San Diego's story on this visualization and our Open Data program during a financial transparency webinar.

The tool is accessible at [https://budget.sandiego.gov](https://budget.sandiego.gov).  

## City Clerk.
Although not live yet, we repurposed the coordinator dashboard code for the City Clerk to help keep track of Records Disposition Schedules.

## City of San Diego Website Redesign.
In order to ensure that it works well with the Open Data initiative, we were heavily involved in the earlier stages, and will continue to be involved in the later stages, of the City of San Diego's Website Redesign project.

## Meetings with Foreign Delegations.
As the City moves along its Open Data program, we are beginning to receive global recognition for our thoughtful and insightful approaches to Open Data.

So far, we have met with delegations from Macedonia and the Phillipines to discuss Mayor Faulconer's advances in Open Data and Open Government:
