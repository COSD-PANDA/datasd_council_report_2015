# Other Accomplishments
## OpenGov
In combination with Financial Management and IT, we were able to launch a public-facing budget tool, OpenGov.

We are one of the few cities that were able to launch it under a subdomain of sandiego.gov, and are working closely with OpenGov to develop new functionality.

The tool is accessible at [https://budget.sandiego.gov](https://budget.sandiego.gov).  

## City Clerk
Although not live yet, we were able to repurpose the coordinator dashboard code for the City Clerk to use potentially to keep track of Records Disposition Schedules.
