# Other Accomplishments
## OpenGov
In partnership with Financial Management and IT [FIGURE OUT A WAY TO CONSISTENTLY REFER TO IT; I THINK WE SHOULD JUST USE JONATHAN'S TITLE INSTEAD OF IT, IS HE THE CIO?, THAT SOUNDS MORE LEGIT; REPLACE IT WITH CIO ASSUMING THAT'S HIS TITLE SO CHECK WTIH HIM IF YOU DON'T KNOW IT], we [TAKE OUT 'we are able' or 'we were able' and just go right for the verb] launched a public-facing budget tool, OpenGov, that to our knowledge is among the most transparent budget visualizations in the country.

Notably, our OpenGov launch took less than 4 weeks, making it the fastest large city deployment.  Additionally, we are one of only a few cities that house the tool under a subdomain of sandiego.gov. We plan to upload FY 16 adopted as well as historical budget data in the near future and continue to work with the vendor to develop new functionality. In June 2015, our Director presented San Diego's story on this visualization and our Open Data program during a financial transparency webinar.

The tool is accessible at [https://budget.sandiego.gov](https://budget.sandiego.gov).  

## City Clerk
Although not live yet, we repurposed the coordinator dashboard code for the City Clerk to help her office keep track of Records Disposition Schedules. [THE ORIGINAL SENTENCE MADE IT SEEM LIKE SHE MIGHT NOT USE IT; IF WE THINK SHE'S NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING WITH IT, WE MAY NEED TO STRIKE THIS SECTION SO AS NOT TO APPEAR AS THOUGH WE ARE WORKING ON STUFF THAT DOESN'T SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY, EVEN IF TRUE]

[I FEEL LIKE WE SHOULD LIST AS ACCOMPLISHMENTS OUR MEETING WTIH TWO FOREIGN DELEGATIONS OF JOURNALISTS, OPEN GOVERNMENT ADVOCATES, SECURITY OFFICIALS, AND ELECTED OFFICIALS' STAFF; I'M BEGINNING TO VIEW THIS REPORT PARTIALLY AS A RAH RAH PIECE FOR THE OPEN DATA PROGRAM GENERALLY]

[SHOULD WE MENTION THAT WE ARE WORKING WITH T&SW ON A STREETS VISUALIZATION AND WITH READ ON A PROPERTY MAPPING OR LEAVE THOSE TO NEXT YEAR'S ACCOMPLISHMENTS ?]
