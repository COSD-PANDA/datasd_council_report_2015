# Outstanding Departments
This is not an easy process and different from what most City staff do day-to-day.  All the departments did an amazing job on the inventory, but there are some departments (and coordinators) that I want to especially thank.  

They provided constructive feedback and exceptional assistance, helping to shape the inventory process. This is not based on the number of datasets each submitted, but rather on their active involvement in the process.

In no particular order:

* Department of IT
    - Jonathan Behnke
    - Gary Hayslip
    - Scott Daeschner
    - Margo Sanchez
    - Debra Bond
    - Noel Gilchrist

    - Sheron Summers
* City Treasurer

# Additional Acknowledgements
* Joy Bonaguro (CDO of San Francisco)
    - Joy is a pleasure to collaborate with and was instrumental in helping plan the basics of the inventory process she is now implementing in her city upon which we modeled our City's process. 
* Allen Gunn 
    - The advice we have received from Allen (Maksim's friend, and Director of Aspirationtech) has been invaluable and has led down the path of better communication with the information coordinators.
