# Outstanding Departments
This was not an easy process and was probably slightly different than what most people in the city are used to.  All the departments did an amazing job on the inventory, but there are some departments (and their coordinators) that I want to thank especially.  They provided feedback and assistance above what was expected, and helped to shape and create the inventory process. 

I truly thank them for their continued assistance and efforts.

In no particular order:

* Department of IT
* City Clerk
* City Treasurer
* Commission for Arts and Culture
* Economic Development
* Financial Management
* Fire-Rescue Department
* Library
* Parks and Recreation
* Performance and Analytics
* Planning
* Public Utilities
* Transportation and Storm Water.
